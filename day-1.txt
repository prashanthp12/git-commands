                        create a branch commands

                        ==> git branch branchname
                                                ==> by using this command we can create branch

                        ==> git branch
                                       ==> by using this command it will show all the branches                       

                         ==> git chcekout branchname
                                                 ==> by using this command we can checkout to created branch                       


                         ==> git checkout -b branchname
                                                     ==> this command will create branch and parallely checkoutv to that particular branch   



if you want to combine two branches we are using merge command
                                                              ==> merge code steps

                                                              ==> git checkout to the branch you want that code
                                                              ==>git merge branchname
